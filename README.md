# App Training "Metabarcoding": Biosphere BASE environment for "Metabarcoding" using Jupyter
For deploying Biosphere VM for training Metabarcoding

## Description

This IFB cloud appliance provides both the Jupyter Notebook and Lab environment to work on Bacterial Comparative Genomics.

This Jupyter app is based on the Jupyter Docker Stacks. By default, this Biosphere app uses the stack jupyter/datascience-notebook but users can choose any other existing stack with an Advanced deployment in Biosphere portal. In addition, we integrated various tools to perform Metabarcoding
